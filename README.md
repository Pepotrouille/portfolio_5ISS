# Portfolio 5 ISS
This repository contains a postfolio I made to summarize my fifth and last year at INSA Toulouse.  
This portfolio is a website made using the Framework Vue.js and typescript.

## How to run it
If it is not accessible through a link, you can run it locally. To proceed, follow the following instructions:
1. Check if Node.JS npm is installed:
```
npm -v
```
2. If it indicates that you do not have Node.JS npm installed, you can follow one of the tutorial ([for example](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-and-install-node-js-and-npm/)) to install it
3. Clone the repository using 
```
git clone git@github.com:Pepotrouille/portfolio_5ISS.git
```
3. Open a terminal and run
```
cd portfolio_5ISS

```
```
npm run dev
```
You should be able to see the website at http://localhost:3000/
