                        My last semester at INSA Toulouse has been an incredibly enriching experience. 
                        The lessons we had throughout the semester allowed me to explore a broader view of field I could work in.
                        And even though some of these fields, such as the MOSH subject, were really interesting, the courses I preferred remained the one linked to the subject I wanted to work in, software development.
                        My internship comforted my choices, and lessons like Service Architecture and Cloud Computing were the ones I liked the most.

                        At INSA Toulouse, another specialty called "Système Distribués et Big Data" (SDBD) focus more on these subjects.
                        And even though it would have been more adapted for my final choice, I am still glad to have been into the Innovative and Smart System class.
                        Overall, and after discussing with people from SDBD, I feel like we had more opportunities to explore other subjects.
                        Our formation is also more experience and work oriented, with reports and verbal presentations, feeling less like another year of purely scholar studies.
                        <br><br>
                        This last semester was a very good experience overall, and I think I will be able to reuse a lot of what I learned in my future work tasks.
